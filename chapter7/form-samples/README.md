This mini-app shows how to work with forms. This app shows examples of template-driven
forms and reactive forms.

`See components/application/application.html for a description of the examples`

## Getting started

This project will use `angular-seed` as a reference. 

To install all the angular libraries use:

```shell
npm install
```

Make sure to add the following packages in `systemjs.config.js`:

- @angular/http
- @angular/router
- @angular/forms

After adding the packages, run the application
